test_pilot

An agentic application for natural language-driven test automation, reporting, and multi-agent orchestration.

Test Pilot is designed to receive test instructions in natural language, orchestrate their execution using Reason+Act (ReAct) or other agentic workflows, and leverage all available MCP tools for browser and system automation. It tracks execution start times, manages test workflows, and generates comprehensive test reports—including actionable insights and instructions.

As part of a composable multi-agent system (such as a logging analysis platform), Test Pilot can hand off results and context to downstream agents for further analysis, diagnostics, or remediation—enabling seamless, automated collaboration across the agent ecosystem.
