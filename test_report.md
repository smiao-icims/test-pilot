## Test Suite Execution Summary

**Test Suite:** iCIMS ATS Platform Complete Test Suite  
**Automation Tool:** MCP Playwright  
**Browser:** Chrome  
**Target URL:** https://configrariet.icims.com  
**Credential Source:** Provided in test suite  
**Test Phases:** Authentication, Job Search, Session Termination  
**Attempts Made:** 3 (maximum allowed by instructions)

---

## Phase 1: Authentication and Login

| Attempt | Result | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 1       | Failed | Login blocked by hCaptcha challenge after entering username. Unable to interact programmatically with hCaptcha iframe. No progress to password entry. |
| 2       | Failed | Login blocked again by hCaptcha challenge. Same issue as first attempt; unable to proceed past username entry. |
| 3       | Failed | Login blocked by hCaptcha challenge for the third time. Unable to bypass using automation. |

- **Observed Behavior:**  
    - Login page loads successfully.
    - Username input field is accessible and accepts text.
    - The "Continue" button is clickable.
    - hCaptcha challenge appears immediately after username entry, within an iframe.
    - Automated interaction with hCaptcha is not permitted; challenge cannot be solved programmatically.
    - Password entry is never reached.

- **Screenshots & Accessibility Snapshots:**  
    - Login page and hCaptcha challenge captured for all attempts.

- **Console Errors:**  
    - No JavaScript errors detected on the page itself; failure is due to anti-bot control.

## Verification Checklist

| Item                         | Status   | Comments                    |
|------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Page Loading                 | ✅       | Login page loads without error |
| Element Interaction          | ✅       | Username field and button interactable |
| Data Integrity               | ❌       | No data accessible due to authentication block |
| User Experience              | ❌       | hCaptcha prevents automation; user would need to solve manually |
| Security & Session Management| ✅       | hCaptcha enforces strong anti-bot control |

---

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

- Repeated login attempt 3 times as per test instructions.
- Attempted different strategies for element interaction and waits.
- Attempted to interact with hCaptcha checkbox, but iframe restrictions and anti-bot controls prevent automation.
- No alternative selectors or direct navigation bypasses the hCaptcha requirement.

---

## Final Conclusion

**Test Suite Result:**  
❌ **Failed – Authentication blocked by hCaptcha on all attempts.**

- Automated login to iCIMS ATS platform using MCP Playwright is not currently possible due to hCaptcha challenge which cannot be solved programmatically.
- All subsequent phases (job search, session termination) are dependent on successful authentication, which was not possible.
- Manual intervention is required to solve the hCaptcha and proceed with the test suite.
- No platform or browser errors detected; failure is due to third-party anti-bot security.

---

## Recommendations

- For future automated test execution, coordinate with iCIMS to request test environments without hCaptcha, or request a bypass for automation.
- If feasible, implement a manual test step for hCaptcha or use a service/API that supports hCaptcha solving (if permitted by policy).
- Confirm credentials and environment settings in advance to avoid unnecessary retries.

## Appendix

**Accessibility Snapshots:**

**Attempts:**
